## Installation

Install the npm package

```bash
npm install -g moses-cli
```

## Initial Setup

```bash
moses init
```

The command:

1. Configures GitLab instance (cloud or self-hosted)
2. Validates token via `/api/v4/user` API
3. Selects AI tool
4. Saves config in `~/.moses-cli/config.json` with mode `600`

## Usage

You can simply run

```bash
moses validate https://gitlab.your-domain.com/group/project/-/merge_requests/123
```

To know more about the commands, run:

```bash
moses help
```

Flow:

1. Parses MR URL
2. Fetches MR data + diffs + commits from GitLab API
3. Loads context markdown files from `~/.moses-cli/context/`
4. Concatenates context files + optional prompt + MR diff and sends to configured AI tool
5. Displays response in terminal

### Why moses?

Like Moses guiding his people to the promised land, moses validates every merge request, ensuring your most precious asset, your code, reaches production safely.

- **Fast analysis**: Fetches diffs directly from GitLab API
- **Multi-AI**: Focus on tested support for GitHub Copilot CLI and Gemini CLI
- **Secure**: Tokens stored with 600 permissions, never exposed
- **Comprehensive**: Generates structured markdown with stats, commits, and diffs

## Features

- Interactive setup with token validation
- Support for multiple GitLab instances (gitlab.com + self-hosted)
- Automatic validation of AI tool installation
- Real-time streaming of AI analysis
- Configurable feedback style (amigável, pragmático, ofensivo)
- Configurable diff changes limit with safe interruption
- **Internal Repository Context**: Automatically scans for `copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `claude.md`, etc., in your project to give the AI project-specific rules.
- **Auto-Download Context**: Option to clone the MR repository if you are not currently in the project folder.
- Optional extra prompt context in `moses validate`
- Elegant error handling with contextual messages

## For local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
node dist/bin/moses.js
```

### Quality scripts

```bash
pnpm run check
```

## Supported AI Tools
